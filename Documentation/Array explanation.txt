Feed Arrays: Indices 1-12
These arrays control the scheduled feed events, with one feed event per index. Each index (1-12) represents a specific scheduled feed during the bioreactor run.
so,

Index (1-12)                                 Represents feed event #
1                                            First scheduled feed
2                                            Second scheduled feed
...                                          ...  
12                                           Twelfth (last) feed

These arrays include:
* Feed_Time(1-12) - When to trigger each feed (in hours)
* Major_Feed_TargetWeight_Value(1-12) - Target grams for Major Feed A (Pump C)
* FeedB_VolumeTarget_Value(1-12) - Target mL for Feed B (Pump D)

So for example:
Feed_Time(2) = 2/60                          ' Start second feed at 2 minutes
Major_Feed_TargetWeight_Value(2) = 30        ' Deliver 30 g of Feed A
FeedB_VolumeTarget_Value(2) = 3              ' Deliver 3 mL of Feed B

State Array s() - Indices 0-12 and 13-22
This is your persistent runtime state, crucial for coordination between script cycles. DASGIP scripts loop rapidly, so s() holds current process values between loops.
s(i)                         Meaning
s(0)                         Reserved/unused
s(1)                         Feed A bottle "time zero" weight (used in Phase 7)
s(2)                         Feed A bottle weight at the start of the current feed interval
s(3)                         Feed A bottle current weight (during feeding)
s(4)                         Target Feed A weight for current event
s(5)                         Feed A event counter (1-12), used to index feed arrays
s(6)                         Feed start time (hours), from Feed_Time(s(5))
s(7)                         Feed B even counter (should match s(5))
s(8)                         Starting value of Pump D totalizer (P.VDPV) for volumetric Feed B
s(9)                         Target volume (mL) for Feed B
s(10)                        Glucose bottle weight at the start of interval
s(11)                        Current glucose bottle weight
s(12)                        Target glucose feed weight (entered by user)
s(13-22)                     Declared but unused by the script logic seen
These values are updated and checked as the script moves through its 16-phase logic engine.

So, summary:
* Arrays indexed 1-12 are feed scheduling arrays - one slot per planned event.
* s(1) to s(2) are runtime memory slots, tracking weights, targets, and phase-related values for each stage.
* s(5) and s(7) drive the indexing across all the feed event arrays (like counters pointing to the current feed in progress).

Additional information:
* s(5) is the master index for the current feed event.
* Each set of Feed_Time , TargetWeight , and TargetVolume arrays are designed to align by index with that counter.
