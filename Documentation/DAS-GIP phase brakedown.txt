Phase-By-Phase Explanation (0-16)

Phase 0: Initializing Start
Purpose: Marks the start of the automatation workflow.
* Logs that the script has started.
* Prepares interval variables or memory as needed.
* Advances directly to Phase 1.

Phase 1: Wait for Inoculation to Start
Purpose: Waits until the process has officially started.
* Monitors p.InoculationTime_H (hours since inoculation).
* Once it's > 0, logs initialization message.
* Transitions to Phase 2 to begin feed logic.

Phase 2: Feed Preparation & Counter Increment
Purpose: Set up for the feed event.
* Deactivates all pumps (A, C, D).
* Normal mode (p.OfflineM = 0):
	* If P.InoculationTime_H has reached Feed_Time(s(5)+1), it:
		* Increments s(5) (main feed counter).
		* Increments s(7) (feed B counter).
* Manual override mode (p.OfflineM = 1):
	* Allows user to control the feed step via p.OfflineN, p.OfflineO.
* Moves to Phase 3 to assign parameters.

Phase 3: Assign Feed Targets & Glucose Sample Check
Purpose: Load target values for current feed event.
* s(5) used as index for:
	* Feed_Time -> stored in s(6)
	* Major_Feed_TargetWeight_Value -> stored in s(4)
	* FeedB_VolumeTarget_Value -> stored in s(9)
* Saves p.VDPV (pump D totalizer) into s(8) for comparison later.
* If procDay > 0 (Not process day 0):
	* Checks if user confirmed glucose sample (p.offlineA = procDay).
	* If confirmed, go to Phase 5.
	* If not confirmed, go to Phase 4.
* If procDay = 0: skip check, go to Phase 5.

Phase 4: Wait for Glucose Sample Confirmation
Purpose: Wait for operator confirmation that glucose sample was taken.
* If confirmed (p.offlineA = procDay), go to Phase 5.
* If not, but still within 8 hrs of feed time (s(6)), remain here.
* If 8 hr window missed, warn and proceed to Phase 5.

Phase 5: Wait for Feed Time (Start Feed B)
Purpose: Wait until it's time to begin Feed B (volumetric).
* Waits until p.InoculationTime_H > s(6).
* If s(9) (Feed B target volume) > 0:
	* Proceed to Phase 6.
* If s(9) = 0: Skip, go to Phase 7.

Phase 6: Feed B (Pump D, Volumetric)
Purpose: Dispense a set volume using Pump D.
* Activates Pump D (p.pumpDActive = True).
* Sets:
	* Pump speed p.FDSP = FeedB_FlowRate
	* Calibration p.FDCal = FeedB_FCal
* Monitors p.VDPV unti; it reaches:
	* s(8) + s(9) (target totalizer value)
* When done:
	* Log completion.
	* Deactivate pump.
	* Move to Phase 7.

Phase 7: Post-Feed B Setup / Record Feed A Start Weight
Purpose: Prep for Feed A (gravimetric).
* Deactivates Pump D.
* Updates s(1) with Scale_Weight(1) - "zero" weight of Feed A bottle.
* If feed is comp;ete or invalid, loop back to Phase 2.
* Otherwise, continue to Phase 8.

Phase 8: Record Feed A Interval Start Weight
Purpose: Record weight just before Feed A starts.
* Records s(2) from Scale_Weight(2) (interval start weight).
* Waits for p.InoculationTime_H > s(6).
* If s(4) (target weight for Feed A) > 0 -> got to Phase 9.
* If 0 -> skip to Phase 10.

Phase 9: Feed A (Pump C, Gravimetric)
Purpose: Deliver a specific weight of Feed A.
* Continuously updates s(3) from Scale_Weight(3) (current weight).
* Activates Pump C.
* Calculates how much has been dispensed:
	MajorFeed_Fed = s(2) - s(3)
* If within 75% of target (s(4)), reduce flow rate.
* If feed target reached -> stop pump, go to Phase 10.
* If manual reset triggered (p.offlineO = 2), go back to Phase 2.

Phase 10: Glucose Feed Decision
Purpose: Determine if Glucose feed is required.
* If procDay = 0 -> skip, go to Phase 15.
* If sample confirmed (p.offlineA - procDay) -> Phase 12.
* If not confirmed -> prompt user, go to Phase 11.

Phase 11: Wait or Skip Glucose
Purpose: Handle unconfirmed glucose sample.
* Waits for confirmation.
* If confirmed -> Phase 12.
* If deadline missed -> warn and jump to Phase 14.

Phase 12: Record Glucose Start Weight & Target
Purpose: Setup for glucose feed.
* Records:
	* s(10) = Scale_Weight(4) (interval start)
	* s(12) = p.offlineB (target weight entered by user)
* When time reached, move to Phase 13

Phase 13: Glucose Feed Pre-Check
Purpose: Final check before glucose delivery.
* If s(12) = 0 -> skip, go to Phase 15
* If > 0 -> proceed to Phase 14

Phase 14: Glucose Feed (Pump A, Gravimetric)
Purpose: Dispense Glucose to match target weight.
* Logs start of feed.
* Continuously update s(11) = Scale_Weight(5)
* Calculates:
	glucoseFeed_Fed = s(10) - s(11)
* Slows down pump if 75% of s(12) is reached.
* Once glucose delivered -> log, deactivate Pump A -> Phase 15
* Manual reset option with p.offlineC = 2

Phase 15: Wrap-Up & Loop
Purpose: Finish current feed event.
* Deactivates Pump A.
* Logs amount of glucose delivered.
* Returns to Phase 2 for next scheduled feed event (increment counter).

Phase 16: STOP (Manual or Emergency)
Purpose: Hard stop condition.
* Deactivates all pumps.
* Not part of normal flow - likely invoked manually.

How It All Works Together
Each full cycle:
1. Feed B (Volumetric) ->
2. Feed A (Gravimetric) ->
3. Glucose (Gravimetric, if needed)
Each phase is tightly coupled to specific scale or pump variables, which ensures accurate and timed feeding without operator intervention -
- except where explicitly allowed (manual overrides or glucose confirmations).
